## About V0.0.2: The slime improvement update

After publishing the game with all of its core mechanics I can now think about what slight tweaks I can make to those mechanics to make the game be closer to my vision.
In this first updated I tackled the slime monsters - arguably the most important element of the game at the moment. The first improvement was graphical - previously
when slimes touched water they would immediately disappear. I thought that might be misleading to new players so I decided to instead make them slowly vanish and then
have their corpse linger on the water. This change led to the next - now that you can see the corpse of a slime on water how much of a stretch would it be for another slime
to come along be able to walk over that the dead slimes' remaining body. So the second change was actually in difficulty: now slimes can walk over water if another slime
has already died in that water tile. This results in a game that is much harder because before you could lure all slimes to one single water spot but now you are forced
to locate all of the water tiles to proper handle the slimes populating the caves.

However the third change is the deepest. I've also been thinking about which other monsters could be made into the game and that begs the question of what exact niche do
I want the slime to fit in terms of the roster of monster that will one day be included. From the beginning I wanted the slime to be a 'dumb' enemy. 'Dumb' in the sense
that if they do not have a direct line of sight to you then there is not much they'll do to find you but now I'm asking myself how dumb exactly. Because previously if the 
slime lost you then they would for the most part just stand there waiting for you to show up again. I think it would make more sense for them to have at least some basic
'roaming' behavior to try and find out and that is exactly what I added in this version. Hopefully this will make slimes more entertaining to deal with.
