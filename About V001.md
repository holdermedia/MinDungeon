# About V0.0.1

Version 0.0.1 is the first publicly available version of MinDungeon. It's meant to be an early alpha and showcases all of the core mechanics in their simplest form. 

I have long been interested in minimalistic game design. As a very busy person, I have always appreciated games that will allow me to just play them for 5 minutes and 
actually be able to have fun or achieve some meaningful progress. There were many games that used to fit this niche for me but in recent years it appears that this style
of game design is disappearing. Modern game design strives to make us 'addicted' to their mechanics and require us to go through hours of tutorials just to get started.
Despite all of this, I still believe that the minimalistic style of game design still hace a place and therefore MinDungeon is a personal passion project in which I attempt
to implement this style in my own way. 

I want MinDungeon to be a game that can be played on any platform but for now it is only available on android. It is not random that I decide to first release on mobile devices:
there is nothing quite as minimalistic as something that you can even play while waiting for a doctor's appointment. Therefore I intend to continue publishing these early alpha
versions of the game on android. When the game is in a more completed stage I will attempt to publish it on other mobile platforms. And when I get to a near completed state I will attempt
to publish it in platforms such as Steam so that it may be played in a computer. 

For now V0.0.1 achieves my goal of minimalistic game design. Many mobile games despite having access to a complete touch-screen interface still resort to implementing weird buttons
or joysticks for players to input their movements. I decided to ignore all that and make it as simple as possible: if you want to move, you just tap on the tile you want to move to. 
For combat against monsters (currently only the slime is available) I also decided against implementing some convoluted weapon systems that would need 2-3 buttons to be 
displayed on the screen - instead combat is mixed with movements. The Slimes are unkillable by your player character but their behavior is predictable: they will chase you
around the maze without stopping. That makes it possible for you to lure them into water and if they touch water their bodies will be dissolved and they will die immediately. 

Regarding the maze, these are procedurally generated from an original algorithm I came up with and so far this algorithm has succeeded in creating really varied maps with
extremely diverse layouts for players to explore. Currently the only goal of the game is to maximize your 'depth'. That means going as deep into the maze as you can. The 
only things that can stop you are getting lost or getting killed by a slime. 

I have great aspirations for this game. In the long-term I visualize this game as some kind of dungeon crawling MMORPG that can be played from anywhere and with very little
time commitment. However in the short term I will be focusing on polishing the existing game. This includes:
-Improving the user interface with a complete menu

-Adding more atmospheric elements like music, more sounds and new tile designs so that the dungeon does not look the same in every part

-Improving the maze generating algorithm to make the game even more interesting

-Global leaderboards so that players can show the world how deep they have managed to get into the dungeon.

-Additional monsters to populate the dungeon so that the gameplay is more varied in terms of the survival and combat.

Once all of these points have been addressed I will consider the game to have its first 'complete' version. After that, I will focus on adding more variety to the game:

-Many more monsters

-Adding unique dungeon zones, perhaps something like a 'biome' system.

-More game modes. In particular, I've thought of a multiplayer 'race' mode in which two players are trapped in the same dungeon and they have to race each other to be the
first to reach a certain depth. 

-Character customization

And after that new improved version of the game is out, the next step will be to start creating a complete global online mode in which players can meet in lobbies and then choose to
explore dungeons with each other, or perhaps go alone. This would include a progression system and many other mmo-esque features.
